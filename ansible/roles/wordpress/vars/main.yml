# file: roles/wordpress/vars/main.yml
#
# Define variables that this role relies on.
#
# Required per-host variables (typically coming out of hosts/group_vars/* and
# hosts/wordpress-instances):
#
#
# - wp_env: The name of the top-level directory (under the /srv of the
#            Openshift instance) where the server root resides
#
# - wp_hostname: The HTTP host name (fully qualified domain name) this
#                  WordPress is served under
#
# - wp_path: The path relative to the htdocs directory where the WordPress
#            instance is installed
#
# - wp_unit_name: The unit name
#
# - wp_unit_id: The unit ID
#
# Command-line variables:
#
# - wp_destructive_for: A list of WordPresses on which destructive action is
#                             permitted.

wp_destructive_for: []   # Default value

#
# - wp_destructive_action: One of "none" (the default), "wipe",
#                             "data-and-code" or "data-only". "wipe"
#                             means to completely and unconditionally
#                             delete everything; "data-and-code" and
#                             "data-only" allows performing restores
#                             (depending on the setting of
#                             wp_restore_from, below) for the
#                             corresponding assets. "none" means do
#                             no harm, yet doesn't rule out harmless
#                             mutations such as creating a WP site
#                             that does not yet exist.

wp_destructive_action: 'none'   # Default value

#
# - wp_restore_from: One of "generate" (the default), "backup-prod",
#                      or "none" to skip the restore process
#                      altogether and leave the destroyed /
#                      nonexistent WordPresses in whatever state they
#                      are currently in.
